"# This is my README"

Created during the first year of my undergraduate course at university. This was my second Computer Graphics in Games assignment. Built in C++ using a library built by our lecturer. The code for this was written in early 2014, this is just a version rebuilt for VS2017 and with the lecturers library removed and converted to an external library.
